<h1>Lobby Service Installation Notes</h1>


<p>Chris Greenhalgh, 2010-09-30</p>


<h2>Building and Running<br>


</h2>


<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>


<p>The Lobby Service code is hosted publicly in the <a href="http://github.com/cgreenhalgh/lobbyservice">http://github.com/cgreenhalgh/lobbyservice</a> github repository. You can use a <a href="http://help.github.com/">Git</a> client (<a href="http://github.com/horizon-institute/notes/wiki/git-installation-howto-%28windows%29">e.g.</a>) to download ("clone") this respository, or the "Download Srouce" option on the repository web page.&nbsp; </p>


<p>The Lobby Service is currently implemented as a Java web (servlet)
application for Google App Engine. The simplest way to build this is
using Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/eclipse.html">GAE Plug-in</a> for <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. Follow their instructions to install Eclipse (currently version 3.5), the GAE SDK and the plugin.</p>


<h3>Building with Eclipse</h3>


<p>You should then be able to turn the lobbyservice repository code into an Eclipse project by:</p>


<ul>


  <li>File =&gt; New =&gt; "Java Project"</li>


  
  
  <ul>


    <li>Select "From existing source" and browse to the checked out lobbyservice directory</li>


  
  
  </ul>


  
  
  <ul>


    <li>Next / Finish</li>


  
  
  </ul>


  <li>Select Build Path =&gt; Configure Build Path,&nbsp;</li>


  
  
  <ul>


    <li>in the source tab remove test/src if present (tests are compiled and run using a separate ANT build process)</li>


    <li>in the libraries tab, remove the GAE .jar files listed as
\lobbyservice\war\..., i.e. leave jcoord.jar and org.json.jar, but
remove the others.</li>


  
  
  </ul>


  <li>Open the next project's Properties</li>


  
  
  <ul>


    <li>open the Google item (tree), select App Engine;&nbsp;</li>


    <li>check "Use Google App Engine" and select the desired SDK (previously downloaded).</li>


  
  
  </ul>


</ul>


<p>By default Eclipse should auto-build the web application whenever a change is made.</p>
<p>See also <a href="lobbyservice_software_guide.html">lobbyservice_software_guide.html</a></p>


<h3>Deployment for Local Testing</h3>


<p>In the context menu of the (error-free) project, select&nbsp; "Run
As" =&gt; "Web Application". A console window labelled [Web
Application] will show the console output from the local testing
server.&nbsp;</p>


<p>By default the testing server binds to localhost, port 8888. This
can be changed by "Run Configurations..." =&gt; "lobbyservice" (or
whatever - a sub-item under "Web Application"), in the Arguments tab,
e.g. "--port=8888" "--address=0.0.0.0" (you will need to do something
like the latter to make the test server accessible to client(s) running
in a device emulator or on another machine).</p>

<p>Note that GAE cron tasks are NOT run by the development server; you
will need to set up your own CRON task or equivalent to schedule the
lobby server background tasks. E.g. (in a bash-type shell) something
like:</p>

<pre>	while [[ 1 ]] ; do echo "tick"; curl -d '' http://localhost:8888/cron/RunBackgroundTasks; sleep 30; done</pre>


<h3> Deployment to App Engine</h3>


<p>In the project properties, under Google, App Engine, check/set the Deployment information, i.e. Application ID and version.</p>


<p>In the context menu of the project, select "Google" =&gt; "Deploy to App Engine", enter/update your details as appropriate.</p>


<h2>Configuration and Testing</h2>

<h3>Initial Configuration</h3>

<p>Go to the admin&nbsp;index page, <a href="http://localhost:8888/admin/index.html">http://localhost:8888/admin/index.html</a> - you will need to log in.</p>

<p>Configure server-wide properties as required, e.g.&nbsp;<a href="examples/game_index.json">examples/game_index.json</a>:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Server base URL (<span style="font-family: monospace;">baseUrl</span>) - required - the full external HTTP URL for the root of the server, e.g. <span style="font-family: monospace;">http://localhost:8888</span></li>

  <li>Lobby service top-level description properties, which are used in the RSS-like desription of the lobby service - all optional:</li>

  
  <ul>

    <li>Title (title)</li>

    <li>Description (description)</li>

    <li>Link (link) - URL for more information about the lobby service</li>

    <li>Language (language) - code of language used for title, description, etc. (optional)</li>

    <li>TTL, minutes (ttlMinutes) - suggested Time-To-Live in minutes
of information items (e.g. game records) served by the lobby service,
i.e. suggested cache time [not used at present]</li>

    <li>Image URL (imageUrl) - URL of an image/icon for the lobby service</li>

  
  </ul>

  <li>Server-wide game instance creation limits:</li>

  
  <ul>

    <li>max new instance 'tokens' max (maxNewInstanceTokensMax) - the
maximum instance creating 'credit' that a GameInstanceFactory can
accumulate, i.e. the largest number of new game instances that a
GameInstanceFactory can ever create in one go.</li>

    <li>max new instance 'tokens' per hour
(maxNewInstanceTokensPerHour) - the maximum rate at which a
GameInstanceFactory can accumulate new instance-creating 'credit', i.e.
the highest sustained rate at which a GameInstanceFactory can create
new GameInstances.</li>

  
  </ul>

</ul>

<h3>Other Administrative Tasks</h3>

<p>The Accounts page, <a href="http://localhost:8888/admin/accounts.html">http://localhost:8888/admin/accounts.html</a>
lists all known user accounts and the their game template quota, i.e.
how many GameTemplates (distinct games) they are allowed to create in
total. New accounts are created each time a new user successfully
authenticates, but their initial quota will be 0, i.e. they will not be
able to create any Game Templates.</p>

<p>Note that accessing the admin pages does NOT currently create an
Account; you will need to log into the user pages and then return to
the admin accounts page in order to give yourself a game template quota.</p>

<p>There is a button on the admin index page which allows the
administrator to manually run background tasks. These should be run
automatically on the real GAE server (see note on CRON jobs, above). </p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
See the game operator's introduction, in particular for Exploding Places.</p>

<p>There is a browser-based 'player' interface accessible as <a href="http://localhost:8888/browser/all_games.html">http://localhost:8888/browser/all_games.html</a>.
This page will show the lobby server general information (title,
description, etc.) plus a list of current Game Templates; there are
links from each to a template-specific browser interface, which in turn
allows specific game instances to be found, created and (nominally)
joined.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

  <li>2010-09-30: Created first version.</li>
  <li>2010-10-01: added lobbyserver_software_guide link</li>
