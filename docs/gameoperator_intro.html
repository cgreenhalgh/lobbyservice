<h1>Lobby Service Game Operator's Guide</h1>

<p>Chris Greenhalgh, 2010-09-30</p>

<h2>The Game Operator<br>

</h2>

<p>A game operator is provides games to players. They use the
lobby service to:</p>

<ul>

  <li> advertise available games to players, and</li>

  <li>to handle the process of players reserving places in and
joining specific games.</li>

  <ul>

    <li>in principle this could include charging and paying for
'tickets' [not yet implemented]&nbsp; </li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<p>The may also use the lobby service to manage their own game
servers, in particular to:</p>

<ul>

  <li>start/stop individual game engines/instances,</li>

  <li>create new game engines/instances,</li>

  <li>start/stop/migrate the game servers themselves, possibly
cloud-hosted (e.g. on Amazon EC2) [not yet implemented]</li>

</ul>

<p>It is assumed that the game operator pays (or at least is
liable to
pay) to use the lobby service. As such, game operator actions must all
be authenticated, and key operations by the game operator and by the
lobby on their behalf must be audited for accounting purposes. They
might in turn charge players with a view to covering costs and/or
making a profit, but note that the charging structure for players will
typically be different to that for game operators (which may be more
directly related to underlying costs incurred by the lobby service).</p>

<h2>Main Concepts</h2>

<p>The following are the main lobby service concepts that are
relevant
to a game operator. They are also some&nbsp;of the main types in
the
lobby service database.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Account</span>:
Every authenticated user is represented within the lobby service by an
Account
record. At present a game operator is simply an Account with a positive
non-zero game template quota (this quota it set by the lobby
service&nbsp;administrator using the admin accounts page, <a href="http://localhost:8888/admin/accounts.html">http://localhost:8888/admin/accounts.html</a>).</p>

<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game Template</span>
represents a
particular type of game or game 'brand', for example 'chess', or
'drafts'. The example Game Template is the Exploding Places game
developed by Active Ingredient and Horizon, initially commissioned by
StreamArts and piloted in Woolwich 24th July 2010.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Game Client
Template</span>: each Game Template has a set of associated Game
Client Templates, each of which describes a particular client (device
and/or application) that is supported by the game, i.e. can play the
game. For example, a client might be "Android" mobile phone, at least
version "1"."6".&nbsp;</p>

<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game Instance</span>
represents a
single game as played by a particular set of players at a particular
time (and perhaps in a particular place), e.g. for example the specific
game of chess played by Alice and Bob at 3:45pm on 30th September 2010
at the Dog and Duck public house in Wembley. By analagy with cinema (or
theatre) a Game Template represents particular film (or show) while a
Game Instance represents a particular showing (or performance).</p>

<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game Instance
Slot</span> represents one 'slot' for a player in a particular
Game Instance. In
the cinema analogy it corresponds to a single seat in the auditorium.
When a slot is FREE it can be allocated on request to a new player
wishing to join that Game Instance. At present Game Instance Slots are
created dynamically as required, up to a limit specified by the Game
Instance.&nbsp;A player can reserve a Game Instance Slot in advance
of
the game starting, provided that the Game Instance itself exists (and
there are available slots).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Client</span>:
A player accesses a game using some kind of client; this might be a
particular application installed on their mobile device, a web
interface or even just an SMS number. This is represented by a Client
record in the lobby service. So a Game Instance Slot actually links a
Game Instance to a particular Client.</p>

<p>A Client can be anonymous, i.e. not linked to any
known/authenticated user. Alternatively a Client may be known to belong
to a particular Account&nbsp;(player). This is required in the case
of paid or regulated game access. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Game Instance
Factory</span>: A game operator can individually describe Game
Instances to the
lobby service. Alternatively, where multiple game instances differ only
in timing they can be described by a single Game Instance Factory.
Whereas a Game Instance has a specific start time (past or future) a
Game Instance Factory uses a time range (minimum time and maximum time)
and a <a href="CRON%20expression%20-%20Wikipedia.htm">CRON
expression</a> to specify a set of start times. Game Instances
can be created by Factories in two different ways:</p>

<ul>

  <li>SCHEDULED - the lobby service background task automatically
creates Game Instances as their start time approaches
(template-configured, <span style="font-family: monospace;">instanceCreateTimeWindowMs</span>).</li>

  <li>ON_DEMAND - the lobby service will create a Game Instance
in
response to an explicit request from a player client (if a suitable
game instance does not already exist).</li>

</ul>

<p>A&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Game
Server </span>describes
a service, process or server which hosts (or is) the server-side
component of one or more Game Instances. The lobby service needs to
know about the Game Server for a Game Instance if it is to manage that
game (including introducing new players!), and it needs about the Game
Server for a Game Instance Template
if it is to create new instances of that game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[There may need to be some refinement here such as&nbsp;a
new Game
Server Template type to support the case of dynamic Game Server
creation, e.g. with cloud-hosting]</p>

<h2>Game Operator Interface</h2>

<p>The game operator interface comprises a web API based on
JSON-encoded messages over HTTP. There are a set of HTML/JavaScript
pages which currently provide a simple form-like interface to this API.
The HTML interface is based at <a href="http://localhost:8888/user/index.html">http://localhost:8888/user/index.html</a>
with links to specific&nbsp; pages for Game Templates (<a href="http://localhost:8888/user/game_templates.html">http://localhost:8888/user/game_templates.html</a>),
Game Instances (<a href="http://localhost:8888/user/game_instances.html">http://localhost:8888/user/game_instances.html</a>),
Game Instance Factories (<a href="http://localhost:8888/user/game_instance_factories.html">http://localhost:8888/user/game_instance_factories.html</a>)
and Game Servers (<a href="http://localhost:8888/user/game_servers.html">http://localhost:8888/user/game_servers.html</a>).</p>

The API operations are similar in each case, comprising operations to:<br>

<ul>

  <li>list current items (templates or servers for this operator,
or instances or&nbsp;factories for a particular template);</li>

  <li>add a new item (template, server, instance or factory)</li>

  <li>get an existing item by ID</li>

  <li>update an existing item by ID</li>

</ul>

<p>[at present there are no delete operations, and no operations
to access Game Instance Slots]</p>

<h3>Setting up Games</h3>

<p>The steps required to set up the lobby service for a new game
(template) are as follows (using the browser interface):</p>

<h4>1. Game Template</h4>

Using the Game Templates page (<a href="http://localhost:8888/user/game_templates.html">http://localhost:8888/user/game_templates.html</a>)
create a new template for the game,&nbsp;including:
<ul>

  <li>Information used to advertise/identify the game to players:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>title - the name/title of the game (e.g. Exploding
Places)&nbsp;</li>

    <li>description - a text (or html fragment) description of
the game</li>

    <li>language - optional, language of title/description/game</li>

    <li>imageUrl - optional, URL of associated image/icon</li>

    <li>link - optional, URL to related/descriptive web page.</li>

  </ul>

  <li>id - The&nbsp;unique system ID for game template (will
be generated if not provided)</li>
  <li>urlName - optional string used to identify the game template in certain lobby service URLs.&nbsp; </li>

  <li>visibility - whether the Game Template is returned in
public lists/queries from the server (PUBLIC) or not (HIDDEN)</li>

  <li>clientTemplates - an array of zero or more Game Client
Templates, comprising:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>title - name of the client type (shown to the user)</li>

    <li>type -&nbsp; main client type, e.g. operating system
name ("Android")</li>

    <li>minMajorVersion - minimum client type (e.g. OS) major
version number</li>

    <li>minMinorVersion - minimum client type (e.g. OS) minor
version number&nbsp;</li>

    <li>locationSpecific - whether the client is location
specific, e.g. a mobile device</li>

    <li>appLaunchUrl - base URL used to launch the game client
application on the client device, e.g. a web page for a browser-based
client or based on a custom URL scheme for an installed client.</li>

    <li>appMarketUrl - URL to open on the client to support
installation/checking of the client application (if required) </li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<p>Note that the Game Template's ID is part of the query URL that a
player's lobby client needs in order to search for instances of this
Game Template. Consequently it may be compiled into client applications
in some cases, and care should be taken on lobby service restores (or
equivalent) to preserve Game Template IDs. Alternatively the urlName
can be used in variant URLs, but this more obviously implies an
arbitration mechanism for choosing/allocating these values, which might
easily conflict.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, <a href="examples/game_template.json">examples/game_template.json</a>:</p>

<pre>{<br>	"id": "165acda5-8f63-4dd1-a883-cb39a61f1d94", <br>	"title": "exploding places", <br>	"description": "Exploding places!", <br>	"link": "http://github.com/mdf/exploding/wiki", <br>	"imageUrl": "http://89.200.142.192/favicon.ico", <br>	"visibility": "PUBLIC", <br>	"clientTemplates":<br>	[<br>	{<br>	"title": "test client", <br>	"clientType": "Android", <br>	"minMajorVersion": 1,<br>	"minMinorVersion": 6, <br>	"minUpdateVersion": 0, <br>	"locationSpecific": true, <br>	"appLaunchUrl": "uk.ac.horizon.ug.exploding:///", <br>	"appMarketUrl": "http://github.com/mdf/explodingclient/raw/master/explodingclient.apk"<br>	}<br>	]<br>}</pre>

<h4>2. Game Server</h4>

<p>Using the Game Servers page&nbsp;(<a href="http://localhost:8888/user/game_servers.html">http://localhost:8888/user/game_servers.html</a>)
define a new Game Server record for the game, including:</p>

<ul>

  <li>title - for the game operator</li>

  <li>type - the particular type of Game Server, which in turn
defines the protocol used by the lobby service to communicate with the
game server; current options:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>EXPLODING_PLACES - the Exploding Places game server</li>

    <li>[Note that adding more server types requires server code
extensions, in particular a new class implementing <span style="font-family: monospace;">uk.ac.horizon.ug.lobby.server.ServerProtocol</span>
and a new enumeration value in <span style="font-family: monospace;">uk.ac.horizon.ug.lobby.model.GameServerType</span>
which references it; the web form also need updating to include the new
option]</li>

  </ul>

  <li>gameTemplateId - each Game Server is specific to a single
Game Template (required)</li>

  <li>baseUrl - the URL of the server, passed to the
server-type-specific ServerProtocol implementation code.</li>

  <li>lobbySharedSecret - optional (protocol-dependent) string
which is a shared secret with the game server, for type-specific
authentication.</li>

  <li>targetStatus - whether the game server is <span style="font-style: italic;">supposed</span> to be
running at the moment (UP) or not (STOPPED). The lobby service should
not attempt to contact the game server if it is nominally STOPPED.</li>

</ul>

For example, <a href="examples/game_server.json">examples/game_server.json</a>:<br>

<pre>{<br>	"baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080/exploding",<br>	"gameTemplateId": "165acda5-8f63-4dd1-a883-cb39a61f1d94",<br>	"key": "ahBjaHJpcy1ncmVlbmhhbGdochALEgpHYW1lU2VydmVyGAIM",<br>	"title": "server1",<br>	"lobbySharedSecret": "1234",<br>	"targetStatus": "UP",<br>	"type": "EXPLODING_PLACES"<br>}</pre>

<h4>3. Game Instance Factory</h4>

<p>If there are to be repeated games or games created on demand
then you should use the Game Instance Factory page (<a href="http://localhost:8888/user/game_instance_factories.html">http://localhost:8888/user/game_instance_factories.html</a>)
to describe them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that there can be more than one Game Instance Factory for
a
single game, e.g. one for each distinct location where Game Instances
are player, or one for open (anonymous) games and another for paid
games, and so on.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>

<p>The Game Instance Factory UI requires that you choose a Game
Template before&nbsp;viewing/creating/updating the Game Instance
Factories for that Game Template.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>

<p>Each Game Instance Factory includes:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Information used to advertise/identify the game to players
(in the case of ON_DEMAND GameInstanceFactories which are directly
visible to players):</li>

  <ul>

    <li>title</li>

    <li>visibility - whether the factory itself is in fact made
visible to players (PUBLIC) or not (HIDDEN); typically an ON_DEMAND
factory will be PUBLIC but a SCHEDULED factory may not (at least if
GameInstances are created well in advance).</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Information&nbsp;passed on to created Game Instances,
in particular</li>

  <ul>

    <li>Information&nbsp;which is in turn used to
advertise/identify those Game Instances to players:</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <ul>

      <li>instanceTitle - the title for the created instance(s)</li>

    </ul>

    <ul>

      <li>instanceVisibility - visibility of the created
instance(s) (PUBLIC or HIDDEN)</li>

    </ul>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <li>Instance location information (also used when advertising
ON_DEMAND Game Instance Factories):</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <ul>

      <li>locationType - whether the Game Instance can be played
anywhere (GLOBAL), or only in a certain place/area
(SPECIFIED_LOCATION), or, for an ON_DEMAND instance, at the location of
the requesting player (PLAYER_LOCATION).&nbsp;</li>

    </ul>

    <ul>

      <li>locationName - how the location constraint (if any) is
named/described to the player.&nbsp;</li>

    </ul>

    <ul>

      <li>latitudeE6 - for a&nbsp;location-specific game, the
latitude (N/S) in degrees x 10^6 (i.e. in whole micro-degrees) of the
game (centre).</li>

    </ul>

    <ul>

      <li>longitudeE6 - for a&nbsp;location-specific game,
the longitude (E/W) in degrees x 10^6 (i.e. in whole micro-degrees) of
the game (centre).</li>

    </ul>

    <ul>

      <li>radiusMetres - for a location-specific game, the radius
in metres of the area in which the game can be played.</li>

    </ul>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <li>Instance game joining information:</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <ul>

      <li>maxNumSlots - the maximum number of Game Instance Slots
for the the Game Instance, and therefore the maximum number of players.</li>

    </ul>

    <ul>

      <li>allowAnonymousClient - whether anonymous
(unauthenticated) clients are allowed to join the game.</li>

    </ul>

    <li>Instance timing information:</li>

    <ul>

      <li>durationMs - length of each game in ms (used to
determine Game Instance endTime given its startTime).</li>

    </ul>

  </ul>

  <li>Instance timing information, which specifies possible
startTimes of created instances (also used when advertising ON_DEMAND
Game Instance Factories):</li>

  <ul>

    <li>minTime - earliest allowed instance start time (i.e.
nominal game start time) (Java time, i.e. ms since 1st Jan 1970)</li>

    <li>maxTime - latest allowed instance start time</li>

    <li>startTimeCron - simple <a href="CRON%20expression%20-%20Wikipedia.htm">CRON-expression</a>
specifying possible start times (considered only between minTime and
maxTime), e.g. "0 0 9-17 * * Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri *" would be hourly,
9am- 5pm inclusive, on weekdays.</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Information used to limit the rate at which new Game
Instances can be created:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>newInstanceTokens - the number of new Game Instances that
could be made immediately and at once, if required</li>

    <li>newInstanceTokensMax - the most Game Instances that could
ever be made at once, i.e. the maximum value that newInstanceTokens is
allowed to reach. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:
may also be capped by&nbsp; server-wide configuration
(maxNewInstanceTokensMax).</li>

    <li>newInstanceTokensPerHour - the rate (per hour) at which
newInstanceTokens increases and therefore the maximum sustained rate at
which new Game Instances can be created.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: may also be
capped by&nbsp; server-wide configuration
(maxNewInstanceTokensPerHour).</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Information used to manage the creation of new Game
Instances in the lobby service:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>type - whether Game Instances are all automatically
created by the lobby service (background task) whenever they are
approaching (SCHEDULED) or whether Game Instances are only created by
the lobby service when specifically requested by client(s) (ON_DEMAND)</li>

    <li>instanceCreateTimeWindowMs - for SCHEDULED games, how far
ahead of time they are created.</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <li>createForAnonymousClient - for ON_DEMAND games, whether a
Game Instance will be made in response to a request from an anonymous
(unauthenticated) Client.</li>

    <li>allowPrivateInstances - for ON_DEMAND games, whether a
client can request a HIDDEN GameInstance, i.e. one which will not be
visible to other players.</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Information used to create and&nbsp;manage running the
game(s) themselves on the Game Server:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>gameServerId - the ID of the GameServer, which identifies
the protocol (ServerProtocol class) to use and the baseUrl of the
server.</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <li>serverConfigJson - additional type- and template-specific
configuration for the server encoded as a JSON object, e.g. for the
Exploding Places server "{'contentGroup':{'location':'Woolwich'}}"
tells the ExplodingPlacesServerProtocol class to use a ContentGroup on
the exploding places game server with 'location' 'Woolwich' when
createing new games.&nbsp;</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <li>serverCreateTimeOffsetMs - relative to the GameInstance
startTime (i.e. nominal game start time) when should the server's game
instance be started, e.g. "-30000" is 30s before.</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <li>serverStartTimeOffsetMs - relative to the GameInstance
startTime when should the game server be told to actually "start" the
game (this may be a no-op on some games/game servers)</li>

    <li>serverEndingTimeOffsetMs - relative to the GameInstance
endTime when should the game server be told that the game is
"ending"&nbsp;(this may be a no-op on some games/game servers)</li>

    <li>serverEndTimeOffsetMs - relative to the GameInstance
endTime when should the game server be told that the game has
"ended"&nbsp;(this may be a no-op on some games/game servers)</li>

  </ul>

</ul>

For example, <br>

<ul>

  <li><a href="examples/game_instance_factory.json">examples/game_instance_factory.json</a>
- a SCHEDULED Game Instance Factory</li>

  <li><a href="examples/game_instance_factory_ondemand.json">examples/game_instance_factory_ondemand.json</a>
- an ON_DEMAND Game Instance Factory</li>

</ul>

Note that if you use the above sample then in each case the
gameServerId must be subsequently specified (it will be different for
each server/installation as the Game Server's ID is only generated when
it is added to the lobby service (previous step).
<h4>4. Game Instance</h4>

<p>If a Game Instance Template (above) is not used then Game
Instances can be defined individually by the game operator; use the
Game Instance page (<a href="http://localhost:8888/user/game_instances.html">http://localhost:8888/user/game_instances.html</a>)
to describe them. This page can also be used to do simple monitoring
and management of Game Instances created automatically from a Game
Instance Factory (above).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Game Instance Factory UI requires that you choose a Game
Template before&nbsp;viewing/creating/updating the Game Instance
Factories for that Game Template.</p>

<p>Each Game Instance&nbsp;includes the following information:<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>

<ul>

  <li>Information&nbsp;which is used to advertise/identify
the Game Instance to players:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>title - the title for the created instance(s)</li>

    <li>visibility - whether the instance will be visible to
player searches (PUBLIC) or not (HIDDEN)</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Instance location information&nbsp;:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>radiusMetres - for a location-specific game, the radius
in
metres of the area in which the game can be played, or 0 if there is no
limit.</li>

    <li>locationName - how the location constraint (if any) is
named/described to the player.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>latitudeE6
- for a&nbsp;location-specific game, the latitude (N/S) in degrees
x 10^6
(i.e. in whole micro-degrees) of the game (centre).</li>

    <li>longitudeE6 - for a&nbsp;location-specific game, the
longitude (E/W) in degrees x 10^6 (i.e. in whole micro-degrees) of the
game (centre).</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Instance game joining information:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>maxNumSlots - the maximum number of Game Instance Slots
for the the Game Instance, and therefore the maximum number of players.</li>

    <li>allowAnonymousClient - whether anonymous
(unauthenticated) clients are allowed to join the game.</li>

    <li>numSlotsAllocated - the current number of allocated Game
Instance Slots (maintained by the server; cannot be updated by the game
operator)</li>

    <li>full - whether the game is full, i.e. all slots
allocated&nbsp;(maintained by the server; cannot be updated by the
game operator)</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Instance timing information:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>startTime - the nominal start time of the game (Java time)</li>

    <li>endTime - the nominal end time of the game (Java time)</li>

    <li>createdTime - the time at which the instance was created</li>

  </ul>

  <li>nominalStatus - the nominal status of the game described by
the Game Instance, i.e. POSSIBLE (might be created), PLANNED (will be
created), AVAILABLE (should be running at the moment), ENDED (has
officially ended), CANCELLED (will not be/has not been created),
TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE (<span style="font-style: italic;">should</span>
be AVAILABLE but isn't at the moment). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: the main
method for managing a Game Instance is to set this property.</li>

  <li>External game server information:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>gameServerId - the ID of the GameServer record for the
server</li>

    <li>baseUrl - game-specific base URL (if different from the
Game Server baseUrl)</li>

    <li>serverConfigJson - game-specific external server
configuration information, e.g. in exploding places the game server's
game ID and tag (typically set/used by the ServerProtocol)</li>

    <li>status - the last known status of the game server/game
(maintained by the lobby service)</li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<p>For example, <a href="examples/game_instance.json">examples/game_instance.json</a></p>

<p>Note that lobby service does not attempt to manage the game
server for Game Instances that are directly created (i.e. not created
by a Game Instance Factory). The lobby service's only interaction with
the game server in this case is the server-specific registration/login
of a player as they start to play the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Game Instances created by a suitably configured Game
Instance Factory the lobby service background task will attempt to:</p>

<ul>

  <li>update the Game Instance's nominalStatus as the game
reaches its startTime (PLANNED to AVAILABLE) and endTime (AVAILABLE to
ENDED).</li>

  <li>ask the game server to create the game&nbsp;it is due
to start (serverCreateTimeOffsetMs),</li>

  <li>tell the game server to start the game when it is due to
start (serverStartTimeOffsetMs) - may be a null operation</li>

  <li>tell the game server that the game is ending&nbsp;when
it is due to end (serverEndingTimeOffsetMs) - may be a null operation</li>

  <li>ask the game server to end the game when it is due to end
(serverEndTimeOffsetMs)&nbsp;</li>

</ul>

<p>If the lobby is successful in interacting with the game server
then the status and nominalStatus will be updated accordingly. If there
are errors when interacting with the game server then the status (and
as appropriate the&nbsp;nominalStatus)&nbsp; will reflect this
(e.g. the Game can be automatically marked as TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE).</p>

<h3>Monitoring</h3>

<p>A full game operating monitoring interface has not yet been
created/defined.</p>

<p>At present the Game Instance page can be used to monitor the
creation and management of Game Instances (per Game Template).</p>

<p>Some additional audit information is recorded in
GameTemplateAuditRecords, but these are not currently accessible in the
game operator UI.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:
creating GameInstances and managing game servers are performed by the
lobby service background task which is currently scheduled as a CRON
job (or may be called manually from the lobby Admin interface).</p>
