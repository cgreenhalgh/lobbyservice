<h1>Lobby Service Design Notes</h1>

<p>Chris Greenhalgh, 2010-08-17</p>
<h2>Client interaction</h2>

<p>There are two main client interactions:</p>

<ol>

  <li>list available games (for this client)</li>

  <li>join specific game</li>

</ol>
<p>
The first interaction is based on a previously downloaded (probably statically served) lobby service description file.&nbsp;</p>
See <a href="lobbyservice_interaction_notes.html">lobbyservice_interaction_notes.html</a> for more details of the proposed interaction.
<h2>Data Model</h2>

<p>Main entities:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Client -&nbsp;device, typically</li>

  <li>User - person with some sort of account [e.g. for admin / orchestration, or instead of ticketing]</li>

  <li>Game Server -&nbsp;specific game server, e.g. droolstest
instance [for internal management, e.g status tracking, instance
creation]</li>

  <li>Game Template - information about a family of similar game
instances, which might be useful to create them, c.f. a droolstest
template. May be linked to a particular Game Server or perhaps a type
of Game Server. [for internal management and&nbsp;instance
creation/lifecycle; also user concept c.f. film and showing]</li>

  <li>Game Instance - a specific (potentially multi-user) game instance, e.g. a droolstest "session"</li>

  <li>Game Instance Slot - a particular client's involvement with a particular game instance, c.f. droolstest "conversation"</li>

  <li>Ticket - a lobby-generated credential which allows a Client access to a Lobby and/or Game Instance</li>

  <li>Client Filter - client black/white list</li>

  <li>Network Filter - network black/white list</li>

</ul>

And some key Protocol objects:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Client Description - e.g. IMEI, user, capabilities/application versions, etc.</li>

  <li>Lobby Response - e.g. challenge, game(s), ...</li>

  <li>Partial Game Description (or Game Pattern) - (partial) description of a game (or set of related games)</li>

  <li>Game Server Referral - information given to the client in on successful join request to allow it to enter the actual game.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

Initial use case(s):<br>

<h3>Use case: Exploding Places July test</h3>

<p>Loan devices. Custom (game-specific) application. 4 (?)
pre-scheduled game instances. 10 (?) slots per game instance. Single
game server. Single game instance active at one time (may be same
instance reused).</p>

<p>=&gt;</p>

<p>Single GameServer. Small number of per-configured Game Instances
(possibly from a single Game Template). Each with a fixed (?) set of
Slots. Possibly with associated Tickets.</p>

<h3>Use case: Droolstest / Hyperplace development</h3>

<p>Own(ish) devices. Generic application download (could be from marketplace).&nbsp;</p>

<p>=&gt;</p>

<p>Single Game Server and Game Template per development / developer.
Game Instance created on demand? &nbsp;Slots created/allocated on
demand.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
