(Abandoned) Lobby Service Mobile Client - Prototype using Titanium Developer

Chris Greenhalgh, University of Nottingham, 2010-08-24

Note: as of 2010-09-13 this client is not being developed or supported, so the
chances are that it is no longer compatible with the lobby service. The 
'standard' mobile client development is shifting to standard HTML/JS browser-
based, as the additional features of Titanium/native app are not required at
this stage and it allows more code-sharing with desktop client(s).
